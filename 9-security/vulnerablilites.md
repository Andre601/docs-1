# Reporting vulnerabilities

## What is vulnerability?

> Vulnerability is a cyber-security term that refers to a flaw in a system that can leave it open to attack. The vulnerability may also refer to any type of weakness in a computer system itself, in a set of procedures, or in anything that leaves information security exposed to a threat. - by [techopedia](techopedia.com/definition/13484/vulnerability)

## In case you found a vulnerability

In case you found vulnerability or security issue in one of the drivers or the database, please do not publish it, instead, contact us via e-mail at [gabor.brs@gmail.com](mailto:gabor.brs@gmail.com). We will take the necessary steps to fix the issue. We are handling the vulnerabilities privately to keep our users' data as safe as we can.

To make report processing easier, please consider the following:

* Use clear and expressive subject
* Have a short, clear, and direct description including the details
* Include OWASP link, CVE references or links to other public advisories and standards
* Add steps on how to reproduce the issue
* Describe your environment
* Attach screenshots if applicable
